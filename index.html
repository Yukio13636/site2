    <h2>Lionel Messi: A breakdown of his World Cup and career highlights</h2>
    <p>After inspiring Argentina to a historic World Cup victory in Qatar, we look back at his illustrious career.</p> 
    </div>
    <img src="img.webp" class="img2">
    <div class="pbox"><p class="paragrah">Eight years ago, Messi came close to the World Cup, dragging his team to the final in Brazil, only to lose to Germany in extra time.
        
    </p></div>
    <img src="img2.webp" class="img2">
    <div class="pbox"><p class="paragrah">The 35-year-old Argentinian also tops the assists charts with three to sit alongside Harry Kane (England), Antoine Griezmann (France) and Bruno Fernandes (Portugal).
    </p></div>
    <img src="img3.webp" class="img2">
    <div class="pbox"><p class="paragrah">For many, the question – who is the greatest player of all time, Messi or his longtime rival and five-time Ballon D’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo – has finally been decided.

        The Portuguese superstar, who has never won the tournament, was benched for his team’s games against Switzerland and Morocco after scoring in a fifth straight World Cup..</p></div>
    <img src="img4.webp" class="img2">
    <div class="pbox"><p class="paragrah">There were high expectations for Messi’s Paris St Germain teammate Neymar. The forward dazzled at times, scoring two goals but was also plagued by injuries at the start of the tournament and ultimately, Brazil could not do enough to beat a disciplined Croatian side and exited at the quarterfinal stage.</p></div>
    <img src="img5.webp" class="img2">
    <div class="pbox"><p class="paragrah">Messi made his international debut in 2005 after winning the FIFA World Youth Championship that year. At the 2006 World Cup, he became the youngest Argentinian player to play and score.</p></div>
    <div class="pbox"><p class="paragrah">Since then, he has joined his compatriot Diego Maradona as a footballing icon both at home and abroad.</p></div>
